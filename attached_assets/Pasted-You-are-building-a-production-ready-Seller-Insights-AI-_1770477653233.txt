You are building a production-ready "Seller Insights AI" application for Square's APM program.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
Build a full-stack web application that provides AI-powered insights to e-commerce sellers. The frontend displays seller metrics and AI-generated recommendations. The backend serves data via REST API.

**TECHNICAL STACK:**
- Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind CSS (dark theme)
- Backend: Flask + Python
- Database: No database needed - use in-memory JSON data
- No external API calls needed (mock Claude insights)

**BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (Python Flask):**

1. Create `server.py` with Flask app that:
   - Serves React frontend at `/`
   - Provides API endpoints (see below)
   - Enables CORS for local development
   - Uses in-memory seller data (defined as JSON)

2. API Endpoints (all return JSON):
   - GET `/api/sellers` - returns array of sellers with: seller_id, business_name, industry
   - GET `/api/sellers/<seller_id>/metrics` - returns seller data with all metrics
   - GET `/api/sellers/<seller_id>/insights` - returns seller data with AI insights
   - GET `/api/health` - returns {"status": "ok"}

3. Sample Data Structure (10 sellers):
```json

   - Professional typography and spacing
   - Smooth interactions and loading states

2. Main Dashboard Component:
   - Header section with title "📊 Seller Insights AI" and description

     * Overall health status (color-coded: red=concerning, yellow=good, green=excellent)
     * Key finding
     * List of individual insights with:
       - Title

4. Interactions:
   - Dropdown selector updates all data
   - Smooth transitions when data changes
   - Clear loading indicator
   - Error messages displayed to user

**BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Generate all code in a single repository
